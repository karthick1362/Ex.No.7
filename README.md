Date:
Register No: 212223053002

AIM
To develop a prompt-based application using ChatGPT that demonstrates the design and functionality of a personal productivity assistant.
The goal is to organize daily tasks through advanced natural language interactions, explore prompt engineering techniques, and leverage large language models (LLMs) to adapt to user preferences, thereby fostering creativity and enhancing real-world problem-solving skills.

AI TOOLS REQUIRED
Assistance: ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek,Ai

Video Generation: Runway

Image Generation: Midjourney

PROMPT USED
text
"Design a personal productivity assistant that can help manage daily tasks, schedule reminders, suggest wellness tips, and answer general queries. The assistant should interact using natural language and be adaptable to the user’s changing preferences over time."
PROCEDURE
1. Define Core Requirements
Understand natural language input

Manage tasks with priority and deadlines

Provide reminders and scheduling

Offer context-aware responses and proactive suggestions

Support wellness and self-care prompts

Answer general knowledge queries

Learn adaptively from user feedback and interactions

2. Simulate Natural User Interaction
Interface: Command-Line Interface (CLI) or basic GUI

User inputs passed to LLM through prompt templates

Responses parsed and displayed in a user-friendly way

3. Feedback Collection and Preference Adaptation
Records feedback such as:

“That was helpful.”

“Don’t show hydration tips again.”

Stores simulated preferences influencing future behavior

4. Optional: Memory Integration
Store user details (name, preferences, habits)

Example:

text
User: "Hey Alex, based on your routine, it might be a good time to take a walk."
MODULES & FEATURES
1. Daily Task Manager
Natural task addition

Priority-based grouping and summaries

Example Interaction:

text
User: "Remind me to send the project email tomorrow morning."
Assistant: "Task added: 'Send the project email' for tomorrow at 9 AM."
2. Smart Scheduler
Understands contextual time expressions

Detects conflicts and optimizes schedules

Example Interaction:

text
User: "Schedule a study session for 2 hours on Saturday."
Assistant: "Study session scheduled from 3 PM to 5 PM on Saturday. No conflicts detected."
3. Wellness Tips Generator
Variety: hydration, mindfulness, posture correction, screen breaks

Personalized by user feedback

Example Interaction:

text
User: "Give me a wellness tip."
Assistant: "Take a 5-minute break and stretch. It helps with circulation and focus."
4. General Knowledge Helper
Covers diverse topics such as education, hobbies, and trivia

References trusted sources when needed

Example Interaction:

text
User: "Who wrote The Alchemist?"
Assistant: "Paulo Coelho wrote The Alchemist."
5. User Personalization and Learning
Recognizes preferred phrases and styles

Encourages habit formation (e.g., hydration reminders)

Customizable tone (formal or friendly) and schedule (weekday/weekend)

6. Optional Advanced Integrations
Google Calendar API for real-time sync

Local notifications (Tkinter/Desktop pop-ups)

Voice interaction via Speech-to-Text/Text-to-Speech

RESULTS
The project successfully demonstrated the conceptual and functional design of an AI-powered productivity assistant that:

Handles dynamic prompts

Offers multi-domain conversation

Performs contextual scheduling and prioritization

Adapts based on user interaction and feedback patterns

STUDENTS WERE ABLE TO
Apply prompt engineering for real-world applications

Design and simulate user-centric AI features

Utilize multiple AI tools collaboratively (ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Runway)

Recognize the potential of generative AI in productivity improvement

CONCLUSION
The prototype validated the effectiveness of prompt-based interfaces for productivity enhancement.
It fostered creativity, coding proficiency, and practical AI tool familiarity.
This work prepares students to design future AI-driven assistants across sectors such as healthcare, education, entertainment, and professional services.
